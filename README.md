# Squirrel Tracker

The project contains two applications which can help users keep track of all known squirrels in Central Park. In the sightings application, users can see all squirrel sightings information along with links to edit and add new sightings. In the sightings/stas page, it provides users with statistics of different sightings attributes such as squirrels' age, primary fur coloro, coordinate for squirrel sighting points, and etc. The map application can display the location of the squirrel sightings on an OpenStreets map.

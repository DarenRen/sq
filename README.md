# Squirrel Tracker

The project contains two applications which can help users keep track of all known squirrels in Central Park. The home page can lead users to squirrel sightings, statistics of attributes and an OpenStreet map. In the /sightings page, users can see all squirrel sightings information along with links to edit and add new sightings. In the /sightings/stats page, it provides users with statistics of different sightings attributes such as squirrels' age, primary fur coloro, coordinate for squirrel sighting points, and etc. The /map page can display the location of squirrel sightings on an OpenStreets map.
